# Opportunities and challenges with microservices


## Opportunities
- Different programming languages can be selected.
- Each microservice project has its independent lifecycle, so changes/evolutions can be more quickly applied.
- The computing capability of the microservice can be easily scaled up/down based on the business requirements.
- Upgrading of microservices would bring less/no impact to the entire system.	

## Challenges
- High cohesion & low coupling should be restrictly implemented in the design phases. 
- Communications would be more hard than ever.
- More kinds of technologies should be equiped.
- Security/cache/monitoring should be taken into consideration.
